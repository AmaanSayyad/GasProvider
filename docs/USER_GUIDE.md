## Making Your First Deposit

### Overview

The deposit process has 4 simple steps:
1. Select source chain and token
2. Choose destination chains
3. Review gas estimates
4. Confirm and track

### Step 1: Select Source Chain and Token

1. **Choose Source Chain**: Click the source chain dropdown and select any supported chain
   - Note: In the demo system, all deposits are processed through the Treasury system regardless of which chain you select

2. **Select Token**: Click the token dropdown and choose your deposit token
   - Supported tokens: USDC, USDT, FLR, WFLR

3. **Enter Amount**: Type the amount you want to deposit
   - Minimum: 1 USDC (or equivalent)
   - Maximum: Based on your wallet balance

**Example**:
```
Source Chain: Ethereum Sepolia
Token: USDC
Amount: 100
```

### Step 2: Choose Destination Chains

1. **Select Destination Chains**: Check the boxes for chains where you want to receive gas
   - You can select multiple chains
   - Each chain shows its native token (ETH, MATIC, AVAX, etc.)

2. **Adjust Allocation** (Optional): Use the sliders to adjust how much gas you want on each chain
   - Default: Equal distribution across all selected chains
   - Total must equal 100%

**Example**:
```
✓ Ethereum Sepolia (50%)
✓ Polygon Amoy (30%)
✓ Arbitrum Sepolia (20%)
```

### Step 3: Review Gas Estimates

The platform will show you:

- **USD Value**: Total value of your deposit
- **Gas Amounts**: How much native gas you'll receive on each chain
- **Exchange Rates**: Current rates used for calculations
- **Estimated Time**: Expected completion time

**Example**:
```
Deposit: 100 USDC ($100)

You will receive:
- Ethereum Sepolia: 0.025 ETH ($50)
- Polygon Amoy: 37.5 MATIC ($30)
- Arbitrum Sepolia: 0.01 ETH ($20)
```

### Step 4: Confirm Transaction

1. Click **"Confirm Deposit"**
2. Review the transaction details in your wallet
3. Approve the transaction
4. Wait for confirmation

**What Happens Next**:
- Your deposit is recorded
- Treasury contracts on each destination chain are triggered
- Native gas is distributed to your wallet address
- You can track progress in real-time

## Tracking Your Transactions

### Real-Time Progress

After confirming your deposit, you'll see a progress screen showing:

1. **Overall Status**: Created → Validating → Distributing → Completed
2. **Per-Chain Status**: Individual progress for each destination chain
3. **Transaction Hashes**: Links to block explorers for each transaction
4. **Confirmations**: Number of block confirmations for each transaction

**Status Indicators**:
- 🟡 **Pending**: Transaction submitted, waiting for confirmation
- 🔵 **Processing**: Transaction confirmed, waiting for finality
- 🟢 **Completed**: Transaction fully confirmed
- 🔴 **Failed**: Transaction failed (see error message)

### Viewing Transaction Details

Click on any transaction hash to:
- View the transaction on the block explorer
- See gas used and transaction fee
- Verify the recipient address
- Check block number and timestamp

**Example Transaction Hash**:
```
Ethereum Sepolia: 0x1234...5678
→ Opens Sepolia Etherscan
```

## How It Works

### The Treasury System

Gas Fountain uses a simplified Treasury-based architecture:

1. **Deposit**: You deposit tokens (appears to be on any chain)
2. **Routing**: Backend routes your request to the Treasury system
3. **Calculation**: System calculates gas amounts using exchange rates
4. **Distribution**: Treasury contracts on each chain send you native gas
5. **Confirmation**: You receive real blockchain transactions

### Exchange Rates

The demo system uses hardcoded exchange rates:

- **USDC/USDT**: $1.00
- **FLR/WFLR**: $0.02
- **ETH**: $2,000
- **BNB**: $300
- **MATIC**: $0.80
- **AVAX**: $25

**Note**: These are demo rates. Production will use live oracle feeds.

### Transaction Flow

```
1. User deposits 100 USDC
   ↓
2. System calculates: $100 USD value
   ↓
3. User selects 3 destination chains
   ↓
4. System distributes:
   - Ethereum: 0.025 ETH ($50)
   - Polygon: 62.5 MATIC ($50)
   ↓
5. User receives gas on both chains
```

## Best Practices
